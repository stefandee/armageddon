# Armageddon

Welcome to Armageddon, an Armageddon/Missile Command remake.

Started coding it in high-school in 1994, a little bit after completing Plotting. Finished it in 1995.

With the exception of two splash screens, graphics were made by Alex "Alecseiul" Mazilu using ["Zoom Pixel Editor"](https://github.com/stefandee/zped)

The second splash screen is from a very old game (Major Stryker?), while the main menu one is, possibly, stock art.

The original game has bunch of issues: 
* resolution switches between menu and game
* sprites lack transparency
* frame rate is not constant
* shield system is not working

## Gameplay

Use mouse. Otherwise, you should know the drill ;)

## Setup&Install&Build (original)

Requirements:
* build: Turbo Pascal/Borland Pascal
* run: MS-DOS or emulation (DOSBox, FreeDOS)

The MS-DOS release has a slight sound glitch and it might crash/freeze with sound, so you might want to disable SoundBlaster emulation. For DOSBox, irq 7 and dma 5 should do the trick.
